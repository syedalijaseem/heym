"""Postgres-backed broadcast registry for background dashboard chat streams.

The previous implementation kept conversation streams in a per-process dict,
which broke under `uvicorn --workers N` (the POST that started the task and the
GET that subscribed to it could land on different workers). This implementation
uses a `chat_stream_events` table for durable replay plus Postgres
`LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` to wake up subscribers in any worker.

Wire-format compatibility: events are serialized to SSE-formatted strings at
publish time, so consumers receive `str` payloads (already `data: ...\\n\\n`)
or `None` to signal stream completion.
