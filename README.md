## What Is Heym?

Heym is an **AI-native automation platform** built from the ground up around LLMs, agents, and intelligent tooling. Wire together AI agents, vector stores, web scrapers, HTTP calls, and message queues on a visual canvas — then deploy instantly via Docker.

Unlike platforms that started as classic trigger-action automation and layered AI on later, in Heym **AI is the execution model**.

Explore the product site at **[heym.run](https://heym.run)**.

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/readme-assets/workflow-canvas.svg" width="100%" alt="Animated Heym workflow canvas"/>

</div>

## No Enterprise Gatekeeping

Many automation platforms turn essential production features into upgrade pressure: global variables, execution history and search, insights, AI Builder / Motherboard capabilities, observability, audit-style logs, team controls, scaling, or customer-facing portals.

Heym takes the opposite position. These are core workflow primitives, not enterprise bait. They ship in the free self-hostable product because serious AI automation should be inspectable, shareable, observable, and deployable from day one without any kind of weird production run limits. 

Our enterprise offering is for commercial licensing, deployment help, dedicated support, and additional security layers. It is not a strategy for hiding core workflow and AI-native capabilities behind a sales call, now or later.

## Product Demos

The demos below illustrate an **agent–subagent** layout instead of a purely step-by-step, single-thread agent chain. For a request like “How do I get from Berlin to Frankfurt?” *and* “What should I eat there?”, subagents can work on those parts **in parallel**. That tends to finish faster, keeps each model turn focused (less context bloat), and avoids pressuring one model to produce two large, unrelated answers in a single reply.

You can still answer with **two separate LLM calls** (one per question) or run **several calls in sequence** and merge the results in a final step—those patterns work—but for this kind of multi-part ask they are usually **slower** than parallel subagents behind an orchestrator.

</div>

### Generate Workflows from Natural Language

Describe the agents, orchestration pattern, and user-facing result you want; Heym builds the workflow on the canvas.

![Workflow Creation Demo](./docs/screenshots/workflow_creation.gif)

**Example prompt**

> Create a workflow for me that includes a Roadmap Agent and a Best Food Agent. When the Orchestrator Agent receives a request, it will invoke these subagents in parallel and return the result to the user.

### Runing Workflows

Execute the workflow directly from the canvas and inspect each step as results move through the graph.

![Workflow Run Demo](./docs/screenshots/run.gif)

### Create Skills for Agents

Create agent skills from natural language, preview the generated `SKILL.md`, and attach them to the agent.

![Skill Creation Demo](./docs/screenshots/skill_creation.gif)

**Example prompt**

> Create a skill for me and add it to the agent. The Orchestrator Agent will call this skill after receiving information from the subagents, and the skill will create a simple execution plan explaining what can actually be done in the destination city.

### Call Workflows from Chat

Turn a workflow into a chat experience so users can invoke the orchestration with a natural request.

![Chat Workflow Demo](./docs/screenshots/chat.gif)

**Example prompt**

> I live in Berlin and am planning to go to Frankfurt. How many kilometers is it on the Autobahn? Also, where can I find the best doner in Frankfurt?

<summary><b>Table footnotes</b></summary>

1. Zapier Agents support "Knowledge Sources" (upload docs, connect apps) but no user-exposed vector store or control over embeddings/chunking
2. Make.com has Pinecone and Qdrant modules but no native one-click RAG node — you assemble the pipeline manually
3. n8n's AI Workflow Builder is cloud-only beta with monthly credit caps, not available for self-hosted
4. n8n shows intermediate steps (tool calls, results) but full prompt/response tracing requires third-party tools like Langfuse
5. n8n pauses AI tool calls for review through chat, email, and collaboration channels, but it is centered on tool approval rather than snapshotting and editing the whole execution state
6. Zapier Human in the Loop supports approvals and data collection inside Zaps, but it doesn't resume from a captured agent/runtime snapshot the way Heym checkpoints do
7. Make Human in the Loop is available as an Enterprise app with review requests and adjusted/approved/canceled outcomes, but it is plan-limited and less tightly coupled to agent state
8. n8n ships a dedicated Guardrails node, Zapier ships AI Guardrails across its AI products, and Make documents agent rules plus review flows but not a comparable standalone guardrails feature, so Make is marked limited
9. n8n executes sequentially by default; parallel execution requires sub-workflow workarounds
10. n8n uses the Sustainable Use License — free to self-host for internal use, commercial redistribution restricted
11. First-class per-agent knowledge graph with prompt injection and post-run LLM merge is uncommon; other platforms typically rely on external vector DB or manual memory patterns, hence limited
12. n8n's official docs cover HTTP Webhook and HTTP Request nodes plus Code/custom/community extensibility, but I couldn't find a first-party WebSocket trigger/send node, so n8n is marked limited
13. Zapier's official docs cover inbound webhooks and outbound webhook/API requests over HTTP only, not native WebSocket trigger or send steps
14. Make's official docs cover Webhooks modules and HTTP(S) request modules, but I couldn't find a native WebSocket trigger or send module
15. As of April 22, 2026, n8n's official docs document HTTP batching and loop/wait patterns rather than a native LLM batch-status branch, Zapier's official ChatGPT app docs list no triggers and only a generic API Request beta, and Make's official OpenAI integration page exposes batch actions like create/watch completed but not a first-class status-branching LLM node, so n8n/Make are marked partial and Zapier is marked unavailable for this specific pattern
16. n8n has no native LLM token cost tracking; community workaround workflows exist (e.g. "Token Estim8r") but require manual installation and post-execution API calls — an open feature request exists as of May 2026. Zapier exposes no per-execution token count or USD cost to users; AI steps consume tasks only, with no model pricing table. Make switched to a credits model in August 2025 that partially reflects token consumption for Make-hosted AI, but third-party connections using your own API key are billed as 1 operation = 1 credit with no token counting, and there is no per-execution USD breakdown by model
17. Heym emits native OpenTelemetry spans (one per workflow run plus one per node) over OTLP/HTTP to any compatible backend, with W3C trace-context propagation and no instrumentation code, configured via `HEYM_OTEL_*` env vars and disabled by default. n8n has a documented OpenTelemetry tracing setup for workflow and node executions (blog.n8n.io). Zapier and Make.com do not document OpenTelemetry export of their workflow/scenario executions as of June 2026

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heymrun/heym.git
cd heym
./run.sh

# OR — with .env file (run.sh auto-generates SECRET_KEY and ENCRYPTION_KEY)
git clone https://github.com/heymrun/heym.git
cd heym
cp .env.example .env
./run.sh

# OR — Docker with .env file
git clone https://github.com/heymrun/heym.git
cd heym
cp .env.example .env
# Generate required keys and write them into the placeholder lines copied from
# .env.example (replace in place — appending with >> would create duplicate entries):
SECRET_KEY=$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))")
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))")
sed -i.bak "s|^SECRET_KEY=.*|SECRET_KEY=${SECRET_KEY}|; s|^ENCRYPTION_KEY=.*|ENCRYPTION_KEY=${ENCRYPTION_KEY}|" .env && rm -f .env.bak
docker run --env-file .env \
  -p 4017:4017 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/files:/app/data/files" \
  ghcr.io/heymrun/heym:latest

# OR — minimal, no .env file
docker run \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))") \
  -e SECRET_KEY=$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))") \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:6543/heym \
  -p 4017:4017 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/files:/app/data/files" \
  ghcr.io/heymrun/heym:latest
```

Open the editor in your browser at port `4017` in either setup.
For direct `docker run` setups, the `data/files` mount keeps Drive uploads and skill-generated files available across container restarts.
The Docker socket mount supports Docker-based MCP stdio tools and grants broad host control. Docker log access remains disabled unless you also set `DOCKER_LOGS_ENABLED=true` and `DOCKER_LOGS_ALLOWED_EMAILS=admin@example.com` for trusted users. Create the trusted admin account before enabling Docker logs, or keep `ALLOW_REGISTER=false`, so an unverified self-registration cannot claim an allow-listed email.

<details>
<summary><b>🐳 Docker Production Deployment</b></summary>

```bash
cp .env.example .env
./deploy.sh              # Build and deploy (auto-generates keys if empty)
./deploy.sh --down       # Stop services
./deploy.sh --logs       # View logs
./deploy.sh --restart    # Restart services
```

> Set `ALLOW_REGISTER=false` in `.env` to lock down registration in production.

## 🧠 AI-Native Features

### AI Assistant
Describe what you want in plain text or via voice — the assistant generates nodes and edges and applies them to the canvas instantly. No other automation platform ships a natural-language workflow builder that works directly inside the editor.

When a workflow already contains Agent skills, the assistant sends only each skill's `SKILL.md` into the builder context. Large `.py` files and binary attachments stay out of the prompt so workflow editing remains reliable even with complex skills loaded on the canvas.

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/readme-assets/ai-assistant.svg" width="100%" alt="AI assistant builds a workflow animation"/>

</div>

### AI Skill Builder
Inside the Agent node's Skills section, use **AI Build** to create a new skill or the inline sparkle action to revise an existing one. The modal streams a chat conversation, previews generated `SKILL.md` and `.py` files live, and saves them back through the same ZIP ingestion path used by manual skill uploads.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
Build orchestrator/sub-agent pipelines visually. One agent delegates tasks to named sub-agents or sub-workflows — composing complex behavior without custom orchestration code. Configure reasoning effort and temperature per agent for fine-grained control.

<div align="center">

<img src="./docs/readme-assets/multi-agent.svg" width="100%" alt="Multi-agent orchestration animation"/>

</div>

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Pause agent execution at any point to request user approval, clarification, or input before proceeding. Build workflows where AI proposes and humans decide — combining automation speed with human judgment.

n8n, Zapier, and Make now offer native review or approval flows too. Heym's edge is agent-directed checkpoints with public review URLs, edit-and-continue, and full execution-state resume.

### Guardrails
Apply content filtering, NSFW protection, and multilingual safety checks on LLM and Agent node outputs. Define rules in the node configuration — unsafe responses are caught before reaching downstream nodes.

n8n and Zapier now ship native AI safety tooling as well. Heym's edge is that guardrails live directly on the LLM and Agent nodes, support multilingual policy checks, and flow naturally into the workflow's existing error-handling paths.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
**As a client:** Agent nodes connect to any external MCP server and gain all its tools automatically.
**As a server:** Your Heym workflows are exposed as an MCP server at `/api/mcp/sse` — callable from Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP client.

### Skills System
Skills are portable capability bundles — a `SKILL.md` instruction file plus optional Python tools. Drop a `.zip` or `.md` onto an Agent node, or use **AI Build** to draft and iterate on skills from chat. Reuse and share across workflows and teams.

### Built-In RAG Pipeline
Upload PDFs, Markdown, CSV, or JSON to a managed vector store. Then wire a RAG node into any workflow for semantic search — results flow directly into your LLM or Agent node.

```
Input → RAG (search) → LLM (answer with context) → Output
```

### Auto Heal
Playwright browser automation nodes detect broken selectors at runtime and use AI to automatically find the correct replacement — no manual maintenance when the target page changes.

### Parallel Execution
Independent nodes run concurrently based on the graph structure. Use the **Merge** node to synchronize parallel branches. No configuration needed — the graph defines the execution order.

---

## 🔍 Observability

### LLM Traces
Full visibility into every agent call: request and response payloads, tool call names and results, per-call timing, and skills passed to the model.

### LLM Cost Tracking
Every trace records input and output token counts alongside a real-time USD cost calculated from a synced pricing table that covers all major models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more). A time-range filtered cost analytics view lets you see spending trends across workflows — no third-party cost dashboard needed.

### Evals
Define test cases with expected outputs. Run the entire suite with one click. Review pass/fail, actual vs expected, and historical run data. Ship AI workflows with confidence.

### OpenTelemetry Tracing
Export a root span per workflow run plus a child span per node over OTLP/HTTP to Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, Honeycomb, Datadog, or any OpenTelemetry backend. Spans carry workflow id, node type, status, duration, and LLM token usage, with W3C trace context propagated across inbound webhooks, outbound HTTP, and sub-workflows. Disabled by default; turn it on with the `HEYM_OTEL_*` environment variables and review status under **Settings → Observability**. See the in-app docs (Reference > OpenTelemetry Tracing) for details.

---

## 💬 Portal
Turn any workflow into a public chat interface at `/chat/{slug}`. Optional per-user authentication, streaming responses, file uploads, and multi-turn conversation history. Ship internal tools and customer-facing chatbots — no frontend code required.

---

## 📝 Expression DSL

Reference and transform data between nodes with a clean syntax:

```js
$input.text                         // Trigger input
$nodeName.field                     // Any upstream node output
$global.variableName                // Persistent global variable
$now.format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm")    // Date/time formatting
$UUID                               // Random unique ID
$range(1, 10)                       // Generate number range
$input.items.filter("item.active")  // Array filtering
$input.users.map("item.email")      // Array mapping
upper($input.text)                  // String helpers
```

Expressions work in every field — prompts, HTTP headers, conditions, email bodies, Redis keys, and more. 

---

## 🔐 Node-Level Error Handling

Every node supports **retry on failure** and **error branching**:

```
Input ──→ HTTP ──→ Output
               └─── error ──→ Error Handler
```

- **Retry** — automatically re-run a failed node with configurable attempts and backoff
- **Error branch** — route failures to a dedicated path instead of stopping the workflow
- **Error context** — access `$nodeName.error` in downstream nodes

## 🛠️ Development

**Prerequisites:** [Bun](https://bun.sh/) ≥ 1.0 · [Python](https://python.org/) ≥ 3.11 · [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) · [Docker](https://docker.com/)

```bash
# Start all services (recommended)
./run.sh
./run.sh --no-debug    # INFO logging instead of DEBUG
```

Or start each service manually:

```bash
# Start database only
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Backend
cd backend && uv sync && uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 10105

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend && bun install && bun run dev
```

**Validation (lint + typecheck + tests):**
```bash
./check.sh    # Run all checks — required before pushing
```

Or run individually:
```bash
cd frontend && bun run lint && bun run typecheck
cd backend  && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .
```
