# Workflows Tab

The **Workflows** tab is the default dashboard view. It shows your workflow list, folder structure, and lets you create, edit, and organize workflows.

## Workflow List

- View all workflows in a card grid or list
- Workflows can be in the root or inside folders
- Click a workflow to open it in the [editor](../getting-started/quick-start.md)
- Use **Ctrl+click** (or **Cmd+click**) to open in a new tab
- Pin frequently used workflows in the [Quick Drawer](../reference/quick-drawer.md) so you can run them quickly from the Workflows tab and other internal pages

## Search

Use the workflow search field beside **New Folder**, or press **Ctrl+F** (or **Cmd+F**), to filter workflows by title or description. Matching workflows inside folders are shown with their folder branches expanded. Press **Escape** to clear the search.

## Folders

- Organize workflows into [folders and sub-folders](../reference/workflow-organization.md)
- Create folders with the **New Folder** button
- Drag and drop workflows between folders or to the root
- Rename folders from the context menu

## Creating Workflows

1. Click **New Workflow**
2. Enter a name and optional description
3. The workflow opens in the editor

## Import

Drag and drop a JSON workflow file onto the workflow area to create a new workflow. The imported nodes and edges are used to create the workflow; the name comes from the `name` field in the JSON or the filename. See [Download & Import](../reference/download-import.md) for the JSON format and import options.

## Sharing

Open a workflow in the editor and click **Share** to invite users by email or share with a [team](./teams-tab.md). Shared collaborators can view, edit, and run the workflow. Credentials and sub-workflows are not shared automatically; share those separately with the same users or teams. See [Workflow Organization](../reference/workflow-organization.md#sharing-workflows) and [Credentials Sharing](../reference/credentials-sharing.md).

## Editing and Deleting

- **Edit** – Change workflow name and description from the card menu
- **Delete** – Workflows are [scheduled for deletion](../reference/workflow-organization.md); they move to a trash area before permanent removal

## Command Palette

Press **Ctrl+K** (or **Cmd+K**) to open the command palette. You can:
- Search workflows by name
- Jump to any [dashboard tab](./credentials-tab.md)
- Open recent workflows
