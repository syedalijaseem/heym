# Teams Tab

The **Teams** tab lets you create and manage teams for sharing workflows, credentials, variables, and vector stores with groups of users.

## Creating a Team

1. Click **New Team**
2. Enter a name and optional description
3. Click **Create**

You become the team creator and first member automatically.

## Managing Members

- **Add member** – Enter a user email in the team detail dialog and click **Add**
- **Remove member** – Click the X next to a member (creator cannot be removed)
- **Edit team** – Creators can edit name and description
- **Delete team** – Creators can delete the team; all team shares are removed
- **Shared resources** – The team detail dialog shows workflows, credentials, variables, vector stores, workflow templates, and node templates shared with the team. Click a workflow to open it in the editor; switch to the relevant tab for other resources.

## Sharing with Teams

Share resources with teams from:

- **Workflows** – Share dialog in the workflow editor
- **Workflow Templates** – Share dialog when creating/editing a workflow template (visibility: Specific users)
- **Node Templates** – Share dialog when creating/editing a node template (visibility: Specific users)
- **Credentials** – Share dialog in the Credentials tab
- **Variables** – Share dialog in the Variables tab
- **Vector Stores** – Share dialog in the Vectors tab

When you share with a team, all team members gain access. See [Teams](../reference/teams.md) for details.

When you share a workflow with a team, also share the credentials and sub-workflows that workflow depends on with the same team. Workflow access alone does not grant credential or child workflow access.

## Chat Integration

The [Chat tab](./chat-tab.md) AI assistant can list your teams. Ask "my teams" to see which teams you belong to.
