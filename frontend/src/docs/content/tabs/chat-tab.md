# Chat Tab

The **Chat** tab provides a direct LLM chat interface. Use it to test models, ask questions, run existing workflows, or create a new workflow from a natural-language request.

## Setup

1. Select a [credential](./credentials-tab.md) (API key for OpenAI, Google, etc.)
2. Choose a model from the dropdown (models are loaded from the selected credential)
3. Start typing to send messages

## Features

- **Global variables context** – Your [Global Variables](../reference/global-variables.md) are available to the LLM, so you can ask about or reference stored values
- **Workspace template context** – Shared workflow and node templates in your workspace are included as context, so Chat can answer questions about available templates
- **Workflow creation** – Ask Chat to create or set up a workflow, and it uses the same Workflow AI Builder engine as the editor assistant to generate the workflow, save it, and run it once
- **Streaming responses** – See the model's output as it streams
- **Stop response** – Interrupt the current streaming answer at any time
- **Markdown rendering** – Responses support markdown formatting, including inline images
- **Image display** – Images embedded in responses (e.g. from LLM image generation) appear inline; click any image to view it fullscreen. Press **Esc** or the back button (mobile) to close the fullscreen view
- **Copy messages** – Copy any message to the clipboard
- **Clear chat** – Start a new conversation
- **Voice input** – Use the microphone button for speech-to-text (browser-supported). When recording stops, Heym can lightly clean up the transcript before you send it
- **Scheduled workflows** – Ask when cron workflows run (today, this week, this month, or a custom date range). The assistant uses the same schedule data as the [Scheduled](./scheduled-tab.md) tab and can limit results to workflows you own or include those shared with you

## Context Limit

The chat keeps up to 25 recent messages in context. Older messages are trimmed to stay within model limits.

## Creating Workflows

When you ask Chat to create, build, generate, or set up a workflow, it creates a new saved workflow with a generated name and description. Chat then runs the workflow with the details from your message and summarizes the result. The response includes an **Open workflow** link that opens the workflow editor in a new browser tab, plus a read-only canvas preview of the generated nodes and edges.

Follow-up feedback in the same chat edits that workflow instead of creating another one. For example, after Chat creates a workflow you can say "add an approval step", "change the output format", or "şöyle yap" and Chat updates the saved workflow, reruns it, and refreshes the preview.

This is best for requests where you want the work done as a reusable automation, not just a one-off answer.

## User Rules

[User Rules](../reference/user-settings.md) (configured in Settings) are automatically injected into every Chat conversation as system-level instructions. Set them once to apply persistent preferences to all chat requests.

## Tool calls and context size

Each time the assistant invokes a tool (running a workflow, listing executions, building a new workflow), a collapsible card appears in the conversation. The card auto-expands while the tool runs, showing the exact arguments. When the tool finishes, the card collapses to a one-line summary with the elapsed time. Click any card to re-expand the arguments and the response summary.

A small ring badge below the input shows the current context usage as a percentage of the model's window (e.g. `12% · ~9.2k`). Hover the badge to see a breakdown: system prompt, AGENTS.md, workflows block, user rules, history, and your draft input. When usage crosses 80% the ring turns amber; at 95% it turns red.

If usage gets close to the limit, Heym automatically compresses older messages into a short summary using the same mechanism agent nodes use. A "Context compressed" card appears inline to show what happened.
