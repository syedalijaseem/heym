# Settings

The Settings dialog lets you manage your profile, set persistent AI instructions, update your account password, configure chat voice, and review observability status. Open it by clicking the **gear icon / your name** in the top-right corner of the header.

## Opening the Dialog

Click the **gear (Settings) badge** in the top-right of the header. The dialog opens with four tabs: **Profile**, **Security**, **Voice**, and **Observability**.

## Profile Tab

### Name

Your display name shown across the app. This field is required and cannot be left empty.

### User Rules

User Rules are custom instructions automatically injected into every AI request—both in the workflow builder and the dashboard chat. In the **workflow builder** ([AI Assistant](./ai-assistant.md)), they are appended to the system prompt used to generate workflow JSON. In the **dashboard chat**, they are applied as system-level context. You write them once and they apply globally without repeating them in each prompt.

**Common uses:**

- Language or tone: `Always respond in English. Keep responses concise.`
- Coding style: `Use async/await patterns. Prefer TypeScript interfaces over types.`
- Workflow conventions: `Include error handling in all workflows. Use descriptive node labels.`
- Response format: `Use bullet points. Avoid lengthy explanations.`

**Where they apply:**

| Context | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Workflow builder** | [AI Assistant](./ai-assistant.md) requests for generating or modifying workflows |
| **Dashboard chat** | All [Chat tab](../tabs/chat-tab.md) conversations |

User Rules are injected at the system level—they run before every prompt automatically, without any extra configuration per workflow or conversation.

### Saving Profile Changes

Click **Save Changes** to apply. Changes take effect immediately for all new AI requests.

## Security Tab

### Change Password

Use the Security tab to update your account password.

**Requirements:**

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Minimum length | 8 characters |
| Uppercase | At least one uppercase letter (A–Z) |
| Lowercase | At least one lowercase letter (a–z) |
| Digit | At least one number (0–9) |

The password must also differ from your current password. These rules are enforced on both the frontend and the backend.

**Steps:**

1. Enter your **Current Password**
2. Enter your **New Password** (must meet all requirements above)
3. Re-enter in **Confirm New Password**
4. Click **Update Password**

If the current password is incorrect, an inline error message is shown. On success, a confirmation message appears and the form resets automatically.

## Voice Tab

The Voice tab configures spoken voice for the [Chat tab](../tabs/chat-tab.md): pick an **ElevenLabs credential** (or add one inline), choose a **Voice** from your ElevenLabs account, and **Save Voice Settings**. This enables per-message read-aloud and interactive voice mode. See [Chat Voice (TTS & STT)](./chat-voice.md) for the full flow.

## Observability Tab

The Observability tab shows the read-only status of [OpenTelemetry Tracing](./opentelemetry.md) for this instance: whether tracing is enabled, the OTLP endpoint, service name, sampler ratio, and which spans are emitted. Tracing is configured through `HEYM_OTEL_*` environment variables on the backend, so this tab does not edit anything. When tracing is disabled, the tab lists the environment variables needed to turn it on. Secrets such as OTLP auth headers are never shown here.

## What Is Not in This Dialog

| Feature | Where to Find It |
|---------|-----------------|
| **API key management (MCP)** | [MCP Tab](../tabs/mcp-tab.md) – view, copy, and regenerate your MCP server API key |
| **Theme (dark / light)** | Sun/Moon toggle button in the header (next to the user badge) |
| **Email change** | Not currently supported |
